# Starship System Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Combat System Issues ✅
**Problem**: Cannot shoot with spacebar in starship mode, combat systems not engaging properly

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced `initializeStarshipSystems()` with better logging and player ship validation
- Always ensure player ship is set on combat system during initialization
- Improved spacebar event handler with comprehensive error checking and feedback
- Auto-spawn enemy after 2 seconds in starship mode for immediate combat testing
- Added proper error handling for weapon firing failures

**How to Test**:
1. Enter starship mode (press 'F')
2. Wait 2 seconds for auto-spawned enemy
3. Press spacebar to fire weapons
4. Check console for "Firing weapons..." and "X weapons fired successfully" messages
5. Or manually spawn enemy with 'G' key

### 2. AI Movement Issues ✅
**Problem**: AI opponents not moving or engaging

**Root Cause**: No AI ships were spawning by default

**Fixes Applied**:
- Auto-spawn test enemy 2 seconds after entering starship mode
- Enhanced initialization logging to track AI system status
- Combat system properly updates AI ships in animation loop

**How to Test**:
1. Enter starship mode (press 'F')
2. Wait 2 seconds for auto-enemy spawn
3. Look for floating feedback "HOSTILE DETECTED"
4. Enemy should appear and move toward player
5. Manually spawn more enemies with 'G' key

### 3. AR Labels Integration Issues ✅
**Problem**: Enhanced AR labels buried under Starship HUD

**Fixes Applied**:
- Reduced Starship HUD z-index from 2000 to 1000
- Set AR labels renderOrder to 2000+ (above HUD)
- Added proper sprite material configuration with depthTest: false
- Enhanced AR labels container with renderOrder: 1000
- Improved setEnabled() method with immediate visibility control
- Added comprehensive logging for AR label state changes
- Fixed updateAll() method to ensure proper positioning and content updates

**How to Test**:
1. Enter starship mode (press 'F')
2. Look for AR labels on celestial objects (planets, etc.)
3. Use AR label controls in the right navigation panel
4. Toggle AR labels on/off with the button
5. Adjust range and max labels with sliders
6. Check console for "AR Labels enabled with HUD" message

## Key Changes Made

### Enhanced Initialization (`main.js`)
```javascript
function initializeStarshipSystems() {
    // Better logging and validation
    // Auto-spawn enemy for testing
    // Always ensure player ship is set
}
```

### Improved Combat Controls (`main.js`)
```javascript
case ' ': // Spacebar
    // Comprehensive error checking
    // Better feedback messages
    // Try-catch for weapon firing
```

### Fixed AR Labels Rendering (`EnhancedARLabels.js`)
```javascript
sprite.renderOrder = 2000 + enhancedData.priority; // Above HUD
// Enhanced visibility management
// Improved update cycle
```

### Corrected CSS Z-Index (`ui.css`)
```css
#starship-hud {
    z-index: 1000; /* Reduced from 2000 */
}
.enhanced-ar-labels {
    z-index: 1500 !important; /* Above HUD */
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Combat System
- [ ] Enter starship mode with 'F' key
- [ ] Check console for "Combat system initialized" message
- [ ] Wait for auto-spawned enemy (should appear after 2s)
- [ ] Press spacebar to fire weapons
- [ ] Verify "X weapons fired successfully" in console
- [ ] See projectiles and weapon effects

### AI Movement
- [ ] Auto-spawned enemy should move toward player
- [ ] Enemy should fire weapons when in range
- [ ] Spawn additional enemies with 'G' key
- [ ] Verify AI ships are updating in animation loop

### AR Labels
- [ ] Enter starship mode and look for labels on objects
- [ ] Use controls in right navigation panel
- [ ] Toggle AR labels on/off
- [ ] Adjust range slider (5-200km)
- [ ] Adjust max labels (5-30)
- [ ] Toggle object filters (Planets, Moons, Stations, Ships)
- [ ] Verify labels appear above HUD elements

## Debug Information

All systems now include comprehensive console logging:
- Combat system initialization and firing
- AR labels creation and visibility changes
- AI system status and updates
- Error messages with specific failure reasons

Check browser console for detailed debugging information while testing.

## Additional Notes

- Auto-spawned enemy appears 2 seconds after entering starship mode
- Manual enemy spawning still available with 'G' key
- AR labels update every frame for smooth positioning
- All systems include error handling and user feedback
- Z-index hierarchy properly established for UI layering
